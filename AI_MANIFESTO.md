# AI Manifesto: Mathematics for Machine Learning Course

## Our Commitment to Transparent AI Usage

This document outlines how artificial intelligence is used in the development of this mathematics education course, ensuring transparency, accountability, and educational integrity.

## Core Principles

### üéØ **Educational Integrity First**
- AI assists in content creation but never replaces mathematical rigor
- All mathematical proofs, equations, and concepts are human-verified
- AI-generated content is clearly identified and fact-checked
- Learning objectives are always human-designed and pedagogically sound

### ü§ù **Human-AI Collaboration**
- AI serves as a **tool for enhancement**, not replacement of human expertise
- Mathematical accuracy and educational quality remain under human oversight
- AI helps with organization, formatting, and supplementary explanations
- Creative and pedagogical decisions are made by human educators

### üìñ **Transparency and Attribution**
- AI usage is documented in this manifesto and project documentation
- AI-assisted content is marked when significant
- Contributors are informed about AI tools used in the project
- No attempt to hide or misrepresent AI involvement
